# Bank Menu Entry Swapper
The Bank Menu Entry Swapper plugin will let you swap the left and shift click options of items within the bank interface.  
This works with both items inside the bank menu and the inventory menu while the bank interface is open.  
Support for the GIM bank interface is not currently implemented.
