# Bank Menu Entry Swapper
The Bank Menu Entry Swapper plugin will let you swap the left and shift click options of items within the bank interface.<br>
This works with both items inside the bank menu and the inventory menu while the bank interface is open.<br>
Support for the GIM bank interface is not currently implemented.<br>
<br>
Options set via this plugin do not take priority over the *Bank Deposit Shift-Click* and *Bank Withdraw Shift-Click*<br>
selections in the main Menu Entry Swapper plugin, so those will need to be toggled off in order to support proper Shift-Click configuration.<br>
Left-click configuration works just fine with these options.
